# Parkinsons-project
#	Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurological disorder that leads to a range of motor and cognitive symptoms. A PD diagnosis is difficult since its symptoms are quite similar to those of other disorders, such as normal aging and essential tremor. 

	When people reach 50, visible symptoms such as difficulties walking and communicating begin to emerge. Even though there is no cure for PD, certain medications can relieve some of the symptoms. At this point, it is essential to detect this disease and prevent it from progressing.


In our project, we aim to detect PD using different types of Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to differentiate between healthy and PD patients by voice signal features. 

	In response to this critical need, our project embarks on an innovative approach for PD detection. Leveraging the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), we employ diverse models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). 


Our focus lies in utilizing voice signal features as discriminative markers to differentiate between healthy individuals and those affected by PD. This comprehensive and multidimensional strategy aims not only to enhance diagnostic accuracy but also to contribute to the early intervention and management of Parkinson's Disease
